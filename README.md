# Chess-Engine-in-C

This is a simple chess engine implemented in the C programming language. The engine is capable of playing a full game of chess, making intelligent moves.

The chess engine uses the command-line interface for user interaction. To make a move, use the standard algebraic notation (e.g., e2e4).

After each move, the engine will calculate its own move and display the updated board.
